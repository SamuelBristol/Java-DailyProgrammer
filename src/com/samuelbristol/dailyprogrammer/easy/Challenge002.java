 * Challenge: Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply 
 * 		your programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application 
 * 		that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be 
 * 		something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics 
 * 		class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to 
 * 		calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!
